# WAFW00F

WAFW00F identifies and fingerprints Web Application Firewall (WAF) products.

## How does it work?

To do its magic, WAFW00F does the following:

- Sends a _normal_ HTTP request and analyses the response; this identifies a
  number of WAF solutions
- If that is not successful, it sends a number of (potentially malicious) HTTP
  requests and uses simple logic to deduce which WAF it is
- If that is also not successful, it analyses the responses previously
  returned and uses another simple algorithm to guess if a WAF or security
  solution is actively responding to our attacks

For further details, check out the source code on the main site,
[github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f](https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f).

## What does it detect?

It detects a number of WAFs. To view which WAFs it is able to detect run
WAFW00F with the `-l` option. At the time of writing the output is as follows:

    $ wafw00f -l

                                    ^     ^
