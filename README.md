# WAFW00F

WAFW00F identifies and fingerprints Web Application Firewall (WAF) products.

## How does it work?

To do its magic, WAFW00F does the following:

- Sends a _normal_ HTTP request and analyses the response; this identifies a
  number of WAF solutions
- If that is not successful, it sends a number of (potentially malicious) HTTP
  requests and uses simple logic to deduce which WAF it is
- If that is also not successful, it analyses the responses previously
  returned and uses another simple algorithm to guess if a WAF or security
  solution is actively responding to our attacks

For further details, check out the source code on the main site,
[github.com/sandrogauci/wafw00f](https://github.com/sandrogauci/wafw00f).

## What does it detect?

It detects a number of WAFs. To view which WAFs it is able to detect run
WAFW00F with the `-l` option. At the time of writing the output is as follows:

    $ wafw00f -l

                                    ^     ^

## How do I use it?

First, install the tools as described [here](#how-do-i-install-it).

For help please make use of the `--help` option. The basic usage is to pass it
a URL as an argument. Example:

    $ wafw00f https://www.ibm.com/

                                     ^     ^
            _   __  _   ____ _   __  _    _   ____
           ///7/ /.' \ / __////7/ /,' \ ,' \ / __/
          | V V // o // _/ | V V // 0 // 0 // _/
          |_n_,'/_n_//_/   |_n_,' \_,' \_,'/_/
                                    <
                                     ...'

## How do I install it?

The following should do the trick:

    python setup.py install

or

    pip install wafw00f


## How do I use wafw00f as a library in my code?

Wafw00f can also be imported in python programs as a library. 
**Import wafw00f in Python code**

```python
import sys

from wafw00f.lib.evillib import oururlparse
from wafw00f.main import WafW00F

target = 'https://www.example.com:443'
wafw00f_parsed_target = oururlparse(target=target)

if wafw00f_parsed_target:
    (hostname, port, path, query, ssl) = wafw00f_parsed_target
else:
    print('Wafw00f could not parse the given url.')
    sys.exit(1)

attacker = WafW00F(hostname, port=port, ssl=ssl, debuglevel=0, path=path,
                   followredirect=True, extraheaders={}, proxy=False)

if not attacker.normalrequest():
    print('Site {} appears to be down'.format(target))
    sys.exit(1)

waf = attacker.identwaf(True)

for identified_firewall in waf:
    print(identified_firewall)

```
